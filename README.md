* Introduction‚≠ê
* This is a facial recognition based attendance system. It is majorly coded in Python, OpenCv. It works by recognising the faces and storing them into a .csv file. 
* It allows the user to update a new entry and even clear the previous recorded attendance. The attendance is stored in a database to provid a virtual attendance register. Moreover, attendance statistics are available in the form of a pie chart. In the section of [view attendance] , the late attendance can easily be distinguished.
The real time of attendance is recorded as well, making it an efficient alternataive for regular attendances in the schools , offices or other institues. 
For this project,
I have created a folder named ImagesAttendance which stores the data of the attendees. I have stored the images of Elon Musk, Jack Ma, Mark Zuckerberg, JK Rowling 
The file named "Requirements.txt" contains all the tech used and their respective versions too.
The main dependencies used are:
* FastApi
* Hypercorn
* JavaScript
* SQLite
* OpenCV
* Facial_recognition
* Facial_recognition_models (Which is internally used by facial_recognition)
* Dlib (Internally used by facial_recognition
*For ipackaging the app *GUI based version of pyinstaller (Known as auto-py-to-exe) Or simply pyinstaller was used 

* Instructions to run it:
1. Here's the Google drive link. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VIRzIYNrVgvmRkPKOzIUIo_SdMXIi6-r?usp=sharing).


[* I have also created a seperate repo for my app https://github.com/Maida-Iftikhar/facial_reco_attend_application.git. However, due to large size, it might be difficult to clone the repo and then run it. It is therfore advised to use the Drive link for a smooth experience.]



2. Now click download all. It will download a zip
3. Extract it and you will see a folder named "app" .In that app folder you will find app.exe file
4. Run it
5. Wait for the output text in the app console And then in the console it will show you to open localhost:5000/



**Note: You always requested to execute the app.exe inside the app folder only because all the dependencies of that app.exe are in that folder. So no shortcuts
would work.

*On the web page, you could use images of 'Elon Musk', 'Jack Ma', 'Jk Rowlings' and 'Mark Zuckerberg' as these are the stored images in the current database. You
can further clear the attendance to mark new ones.
